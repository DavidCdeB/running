# running
For a given set of folders containing a set of input files, modify these and then run them 


1) Perform the CVOLOPT at each volume (manual...)

2) Run `supercell_freqcalc_input.sh` (that is already prepared for the Landau supercell)

3) **Manually change the input coordinates with the CVOLOPT-ised ones**

4) Run `scanmode_input.sh` will automatically run the scanmode of the 1st negative mode
